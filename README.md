### Const keyword usage in c++:
 const’ keyword stands for constant value. In C++, if we make an artifact of a C++ program as constant then its value cannot be changed during the program execution.
####There are many uses of const key word in c++:
##### (1)Constant variables
Once we declare the variable with const then we can never change this value later in the program.
######code example:
```cpp
void main(){
	const int n = 5;
	cout << n << endl
	n==6;
	cout<< n<< endl;
}
``` 



 


### & usage in c++:

- This is an individual based assignment.
- The due date for the submission of this phase is Sunday, 07/11/2021 at 11:59 pm.
- Each hour delay will lead to one-point reduction in the homework’s grade.
- Your code should be clear, understandable, and documented (comments). Follow a consistent naming convention for variables and functions.
- You are permitted to discuss the following problems with others in the class. However, you must write up your own solutions to these problems. Any indication to the contrary will be considered an act of academic dishonesty.
